As you can see the employment rate for&nbsp;
Americans without disabilities is much higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.680
than those with disabilities.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.320
In general, we have seen people with&nbsp;
disabilities employed at nearly half the rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.920
of those without disabilities.
